# Nixie-tube-clock
This is a Nixie tube clock using four `IN-14` Nixie tubes and a neon indicator

This clock has very little testing and I cannot guarantee there will not be issues. <sub>report issues [here](https://github.com/9551-Dev/Nixie-tube-clock/issues)</sub>

Thanks to [9551Dev](https://github.com/9551-Dev) for helping with The Code!

Base for the daylight savings code comes from [MichealIB247 on instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Adding-Daylight-Savings-Time-to-Your-RTC/)

This clock is greatly inspired by [great scott on youtube](https://youtu.be/ObgmVNV1Kfg?si=6stVlPvzve_kgnGa)
